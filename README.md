# Analytic Short Essay
inspired by Craig Santos Perez' *Unincorporated Territory* series- wanted something artsy, satirical, and exploring the hardly discussed US territories
provided by god (theCreator), US gaze, territories have no platform/voice/choice in profile, built for the takers
logo plays on arrow through heart, common romantic heartbreak symbol, by making it more real and replacing the common native imagery of an arrow with a rifle
satirical critique of imperialism- likening political power plays to careless swiping; native lands are reduced to flat profiles that hardly represent the people themselves; showing America's colonization for the toxic, controlling, rapey relationship that it is
not stopping at colonialism- going further to describe their perseverance and decolonial visions for the future
