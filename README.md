## Notes & Planning
* "Dating" app for colonizing countries from perspective of America
  - Could potentially build profiles and matches for other countries/empires
* Two classes of users: colonizers and natives
  - Natives have no control over their profiles (app creator implied to be western idea of God)
  - Colonizers can match with any number of native profiles
    - Actions impact profile? Such as money, resources, power, influence, etc.
* Beginning plan:
  - Colonizers: United States
  - Natives: Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas
    1. Puerto Rico:
       - 
    2. Guam:
       - 
    3. American Samoa:
       - 
    4. Northern Marianas:
       - 
  - After seeing all Native profiles, maybe show results page:
    1. For each matched: colonized natives, true to life, show results of colonization, hint at future decolonization
    2. If not matched: nothing happens OR imagine future?
    3. Not matching with any: imagine decolonial America
* Need app name and logo
* Need to map out which features and pages to use from the template
