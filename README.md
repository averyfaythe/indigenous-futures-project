# Analytic Short Essay
The All's Fair webapp exists to satirically critique settler colonialism. Though many class concepts are incorporated into this project, the most integral are the colonial gaze and settler entitlement.
* The colonial gaze is defined as "the way in which the colonial agenda seeks to maintain and legitimate power by determining colonial realities, including the dehumanization of colonial subjects and the perpetual separation of Us (colonizers, civilized) and Other (colonized, savage)," according to IGI Global. 
* Settler entitlement is the feeling of justification that empowers and rationalizes settlers stealing property or culture that isn't rightfully theirs. This entitlement is often rooted in religious belief and/or an unfounded sense of self-importance due to innate qualities such as race, sexuality, and gender.


inspired by Craig Santos Perez' *Unincorporated Territory* series- wanted something artsy, satirical, and exploring the hardly discussed US territories
provided by god (theCreator), US gaze, territories have no platform/voice/choice in profile, built for the takers
logo plays on arrow through heart, common romantic heartbreak symbol, by making it more real and replacing the common native imagery of an arrow with a rifle
satirical critique of imperialism- likening political power plays to careless swiping; native lands are reduced to flat profiles that hardly represent the people themselves; showing America's colonization for the toxic, controlling, rapey relationship that it is
not stopping at colonialism- going further to describe their perseverance and decolonial visions for the future
